\section{Introduction}
Cryptography concerns mathematical applications to ensure information security and secure communication in the presence of malicious adversaries. Cryptography can be used to hide data, making confidential information valuable and sought after. Encryption is and has been used widely to conceal plain-text messages and information all around the world. Face-to-face interactions have the freedom of exploring physical privacy, while secrets that are not sent or communicated are best kept, in this way cryptography is the base of digital privacy while still being able to send valuable information long distances.\\

Cryptography revolves around algorithms which are designed based on the difficulty of the mathematical operation that is involved. Adversaries are assumed to be equipped with the knowledge and technology required to break said algorithms. It may be possible in theory to break these cryptographic algorithms, but the time, power, and memory which is required to do so is so unrealistic that computer scientists have agreed to call said algorithms "well-designed systems". "Well-designed systems" refer to cryptographic algorithms that are proven infeasible to break/solve even with powerful computer processors attempting to brute-force and even using inverse functions to try and solve them mathematically.\cite{src2}\cite{src3}\\

Most currently popular algorithms have security that relies on one of three very difficulty math problems:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Discrete Logarithms
  \item Integer Factorization
  \item Elliptic-Curve Discrete Logarithms
\end{itemize}
The only way to solve these functions easily is with quantum computers, and none with known computing power exist {\slshape {yet}}. Only two types of Cryptographic Primitives (to be discussed) are considered relatively secure against attacks from quantum computers {\slshape{as of now}}: Symmetric Key algorithms and Hash functions (both to be discussed).\cite{src2}\cite{src4}\cite{src6}\\

This paper will discuss every type of cryptographic primitive and then explore the mathematics of Secure Hash Algorithms. Commonly referred to as {\textbf{SHA}}, this family of algorithms is published and widely accepted as a secure standard of encryption. Hash functions are just one type of a Cryptographic Primitive, all of which must be defined before exploring the mathematical theory behind SHA.
\section{Different Types of Cryptographic Primitives}

A Cryptographic Primitive is defined as a low-level algorithm that is used to build cryptographic protocols and computer security systems. They are designed to do one singular task and are used as building blocks to create a secure environment. From authentication, to non-repudiation, to private key management, any protocol or system that needs security use primitive algorithms defined as separate secure steps and summing up to a safe system overall. Primitives are assumed to be reliable (using encryption/decryption routines to test how many iterations of computer operations it takes for the primitive to fail) since they are a category of algorithms that are acceptable to use for security standards. Since primitives only perform one task and are meant to perform it extremely securely, researchers can isolate the primitives from entire cryptographic systems to analyze their security and how easy it is to break them. Only when combined with security systems can primitives perform several tasks together.\cite{src7}

\subsection{Digital Signatures}
Digital Signatures are a standard element of many security protocols, and probably the most widely used within computer systems designed for transaction of information/assets. A digital signature (a login, a pass code, a PIN, or even a secret button combination) allows for verification of identity and authentication of accessibility permissions. A layer of validation and security is necessary specially when information/assets are being sent through a non-secure channel.\cite{src7}\cite{src9}\\
The math behind digital key signatures concerns key generation, a signing algorithm, and a signature verifying algorithm.
\subsection{Symmetric Key}
Symmetric Key algorithms are a standard of encryption where the same key can be used to encrypt and decrypt a message. The keys may be the same or they may be inverses or natural transformations of each other for reversal. Symmetric key algorithms are susceptible to many computerized attacks as well as physical attacks such as eavesdropping. Specially designed keys and functions can greatly increase the security and risk of being broken if the method of attack is known prior.\cite{src2}\cite{src6}\cite{src7}\\
The math behind symmetric Key encryption makes use of stream and block ciphers to map every element of a message to elements in the cipher-text. 
\subsection{Asymmetric Key}
Asymmetric Key algorithms are a standard of encryption where a pair of keys are used to both encrypt and decrypt a message. Usually there is a public key (known by everyone) and a private key (known by owner/sender of message). Any one can encrypt a message using a person's public key, but only the person with the private key can solve the inverse algorithm and produce the message in plain-text using cipher-text.\cite{src7}\\
The math behind asymmetric key algorithms makes use of prime numbers, logarithms/exponentiation, and modular arithmetic to produce one-way functions which are extremely hard to brute-force and become harder to break as numbers and values and message length grow.
\subsection{One-way Hash Functions}
One-way Hash Functions are algorithms which takes a message of arbitrary size and maps it to a fixed size bit array. Defined cryptographic hash functions are deterministic (same input produces same output every time), utilize the avalanche effect (small change in input implies big change in output), efficient and quick, irreversible, and collision resistant (no two inputs produce the same output). Many famous and verified hash algorithms exist such as {\slshape{BLAKE2b, MD5, SHA-3, RIPEMD-320, GOST, Whirlpool, RadioGat√∫n, etc.}} The difference between them in the sizes of the outputs, internal states, blocks, words, lengths, and also the number of hashing rounds that occurs in the algorithm. The only way to break a one-way hash function is to brute-force search and use trial-and-error to see if possible inputs produce a matching hash output.\cite{src5}\cite{src6}\cite{src7}\\
The math behind one-way hash functions will be further explored in Section 3.
\subsection{Private Information Retrieval}
Private Information Retrieval is a standard of communications when a user interacts with a server where the user is retrieving a data item and the server in possession of the database is not informed which data item is retrieved. The only way to ensure entire privacy would be to send an entire copy of the database to the user, but that would compromise the security of all the other database items, so users must request blocks of information which are relevant. Many different systems exist, with different orders of operations from requests/approvals to actually sending the information and sifting through all the irrelevant data for the useful data. Private Information Retrieval intersects with Byzantine attacks where adversaries take malicious control of a number of authenticated devices that are part of a distributed computing system.\cite{src7}\\
The math behind Private Information Retrieval lies in different protocols defined differently for each party, but by using finite series and vector math researchers can define a non-colliding system which seems to be the best use-case for this primitive.
\subsection{Commitment Scheme}
Commitment Scheme is a cryptographic primitive which locks in a user's committed value so that it can not be appended or changed alter. The value can sometimes be revealed in the future, but they are binding, making them immutable.\cite{src7}\\
The math behind Commitment Schemes depends on the scenario. Sometimes it is as simple as probability and a permutation to find out the chances that the committed value is a certain number, but other times the math is almost non-existent at first but becomes important such as with zero-knowledge proofs which depend on information the user learns throughout. Still yet, there are way to use logarithms/exponentiation, statistics, and bitwise operations to ensure security of hidden values no matter the environment or strength of adversary.
\subsection{Pseudo-random Number Generator}
Cryptographically Pseudo-Random Number Generator is a method for creating a "random" sequence of numbers or symbols for the use in a cryptographic system. Examples could be a key generator, a nonce (a one-time use number used to identify an instance of a certain action), or even temporary digital signatures.\cite{src7}\\
The math behind Pseudo-random Number Generators is broken down into 2 categories. There exist truly randomly generated numbers which take in environmental factors and measure them with sensors to parse the data into numerals which map to combinations and permutations of symbols. Then there are {\slshape{pseudo}}randomly generated numbers which produce apparent random numbers/symbols but they are determined by an initial value called the seed value. The seed value determines which block is chosen from the string of long sequence of numbers and symbols in every permutation, giving that segment a "random" feel. However, if the same seed value is used in a pseudo-random number generator twice it should produce the same randomly generated number.
\subsection{Mix Network}
Mix Networks are a routing standard which creates communications using proxy servers communicating on behalf of the client, and mixing the messages received from different senders and sending them to their destination in a random order, making the digital trail extremely hard to trace.\cite{src7}\\
The math behind Mix Networks concerns sealing messages (encrypting) using a public key and then appending the destination address with the cipher-text, and then encrypting the concatenation again using the public key. This creates a nested encryption only accessible by the proxy server's private key which lets it unseal and decrypt both the destination and the message to send.
\section{Secure Hash Algorithm 1}
{\textbf{SHA}} stands for Secure Hash Algorithm and refers to the family of one-way hash functions that are published and used within computer science and mathematics. They inherit every characteristic of one-way hash functions as previously defined. This section focuses on SHA-1 and how a message is mathematically transformed into a hash.
\subsection{How it Works}
SHA-1 takes a message of arbitrary length and produces a 160-bit hash value that is interpreted as a hexadecimal number with 40 characters.\\

        \item {\textbf{HASH VALUE:}} 8f0c0855915633e4a7de19468b3874c8901df043
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Implications}
Several different steps involved in the process of SHA-1 make it very evident as to why one-way hash functions have the characteristics they have. Step 4 makes it clear how the output is data of a fixed length because it is ensured that the string's value is congruent to 512, so data can be padded and split up no matter how big or small the incoming data is. Furthermore, step 11 reinforces the fixed length output by keeping variable reassignment to the original five pre-defined variables\cite{src5}.

SHA-1 was widely used through the mid-2000's but is now not considered secure against "well-funded" opponents. Computers strong enough have found collisions with complexity of 2 raised to the 60th power. The brute-force collision search is still the only known way to break a Secure Hash Algorithm intuitively, but SHA-1 is vulnerable to chose-prefix attacks. It was chosen to simply illustrate how a one-way hashing function works in terms of math. The publishers of SHA-1 have also release SHA-2 and SHA-3 after several years of research and collaboration by mathematicians and computer scientists internationally. SHA-2 is a family of Secure Hash Algorithms which use fixed output bit lengths that are equivalent to powers of 2.SHA-3 is the latest member of the algorithmic family, and utilizes more rounds of reassignment, and more variables and words and blocks as defined in the SHA-1 process. SHA-3 has the best security against both collision attacks and length extension attacks (attacks on messages which do not need to know the content of the message). Every string and value worked with in Section 3.1 would be much much larger, and impossible to do manually. Because of this, SHA-3 is replacing SHA-1 wherever possible unless the hashing algorithm is not being used for security reasons but rather data storage/execution efficiency. SHA-2 and SHA-3 can be commonly seen in blockchain and network security applications because of their ability to form hashing merkle trees where data chunks and their accessibility depend on the validity and and authenticity of previous data chunks.\cite{src5}\cite{src8}\cite{src10}
